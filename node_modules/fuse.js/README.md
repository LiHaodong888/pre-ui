<h2 align="center">Supporting Fuse.js</h2>

Fuse.js is an Apache License open source project. Maintaining and updating it takes up a good chunk of time, and there's still plenty of work to do. To be able to provide the project with the attention it deserves, I decided to experiment with sponsorship and/or support. If this works out, I can route the chunk of time that is usually spent on lucrative endeavors to this project.
